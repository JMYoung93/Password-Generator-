# Password-Generator-
## Description
This is a password generator that I coded to create a secure password using any combination of numbers, symbols, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters up 128 characters. This was a challenging assignment for me since I am only now learning about javascript. I had a tough time preventing my page from refreshing with every click of the "generate" button, but overcame that challenge with research and help from my classmates. I was even able to add on a "copy" button to the page that will copy the generated password onto the user's clipboard to paste wherever they would like and clear the generated password text box.
## Installation
Visual Studio Code.
## Usage
Create a randomized password.
